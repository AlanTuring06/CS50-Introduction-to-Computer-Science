## About the Course

**CS50x 2024** is a comprehensive introduction to computer science, focusing on fundamental concepts like algorithms, data structures, memory management, web development, and more. The course is open to all, regardless of prior programming experience, and uses a variety of languages, starting with C.

For more information, visit the official course page [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following weeks and topics:

1. **Week 0**: Scratch – Visual programming for beginners.
2. **Week 1**: C – Basic syntax and programming.
3. **Week 2**: Arrays – Arrays, loops, and data manipulation.
4. **Week 3**: Algorithms – Searching and sorting.
5. **Week 4**: Memory – Pointers, dynamic memory, and file I/O.
6. **Week 5**: Data Structures – Linked lists, hash tables, and more.
7. **Week 6**: Python – Programming with Python.
8. **Week 7**: SQL – Databases and SQL queries.
9. **Week 8**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Web development basics.
10. **Final Project**: A custom project demonstrating learned concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **C** (primary language for early problem sets)
- **Python** (introduced in Week 6)
- **SQL** (for database management)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for web development)
- **Scratch** (for visual programming in Week 0)

## My Solutions

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a week's problem set or project:

- **Week 0 - Scratch**: My visual programming project in Scratch.
- **Week 1 - C Basics**: Basic programs, including `hello.c` and others.
- **Week 2 - Arrays**: Exercises involving arrays, loops, and input/output.
- **Week 3 - Algorithms**: Implementations of searching and sorting algorithms like binary search and bubble sort.
- **Week 4 - Memory**: Working with pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling.
- **Week 5 - Data Structures**: Data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, and trie trees.
- **Week 6 - Python**: Exercises focused on Python programming and problem-solving.
- **Week 7 - SQL**: Querying databases and understanding relational data.
- **Week 8 - Web Development**: A simple website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Final Project**: My custom project developed as a capstone for the course.
