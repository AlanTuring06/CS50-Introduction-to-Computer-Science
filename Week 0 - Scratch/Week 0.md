# Lecture 0 - Introduction to Computer Science

## Welcome!
Welcome to the course! This class is about more than just computer programming—it's about problem-solving in a way that can be incredibly empowering. The skills you develop here will be applicable to many areas beyond this course and even in your future career. However, be prepared to face a lot of information quickly. The journey will be challenging, but also rewarding. The key is to give yourself the time you need to learn and grow. Remember, everyone learns differently, and it's okay if things seem difficult at first.

## What’s Ahead
- **Scratch**: A visual programming language you’ll start with this week.
- **C**: A lower-level language you'll learn in upcoming weeks.
- **Algorithms**: You'll study various problem-solving techniques.
- **Memory and Data Structures**: Topics like hash tables will be covered.
- **Python**: A higher-level language to ease into more complex programming.
- **SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**: Learn about these languages and how to build web applications.
- **Databases and Third-Party Frameworks**: Explore how to use them for building web applications.

## Computer Science
Computer programming involves taking some input and producing an output. The process between input and output is crucial and is the focus of this course.

### Binary System
- **Binary Digits (Bits)**: Computers use binary (0s and 1s) for all operations. Each bit represents a state (on or off).
- **Counting with Bits**: 
  - 1 bit can represent 2 values (0 or 1).
  - 3 bits can represent up to 8 values (0 to 7).
  - 8 bits (byte) usually represent a number. 

### ASCII
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**: Maps specific numbers to characters. For example, 'A' is represented by 65 (binary 01000001).
- **Limitations**: ASCII can represent up to 256 characters.

### Unicode
- **Unicode**: An extended system that represents a wide range of characters beyond ASCII, including emojis.
- **Representation**: Allows for personalization and inclusion of various characters and emojis.

## Representation
- **RGB Color Model**: Colors are represented using combinations of red, green, and blue values.
- **Images, Videos, Music**: Represented using pixels (RGB values), sequences of images, and MIDI data respectively.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Examples include:
- **Linear Search**: Check each item one by one (O(n) complexity).
- **Binary Search**: Divide and conquer approach (O(log n) complexity).

## Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a human-readable way of planning out code logic. For example:

### Example Pseudocode

1. Pick up phone book
2. Open to the middle of the phone book
3. Look at the page
4. If the person is on the page
   - Call the person
5. Else if the person is earlier in the book
   - Open to the middle of the left half
   - Go back to step 3
6. Else if the person is later in the book
   - Open to the middle of the right half
   - Go back to step 3
7. Else
   - Quit

### Key Components

- **Functions**: Lines starting with verbs (e.g., pick up, open) represent actions.
- **Conditionals**: Statements like `if` and `else if` determine the flow based on conditions.
- **Boolean Expressions**: Conditions that are true or false (e.g., "person is earlier in the book").
- **Loops**: Statements like "go back to step 3" repeat actions.

## Artificial Intelligence
- **Basic AI Interaction**: Simple pseudocode for responses.
- **Large Language Models**: Use patterns in large text blocks to generate responses.
- [**CS50 Duck**](https://cs50.ai/): An AI tool for course assistance, but it does not provide direct answers.

## Scratch
- **Visual Programming**: Scratch uses building blocks to create programs.
- **Interface**: Includes blocks, a stage, and a sprite (e.g., a cat).
  
## Abstraction
- **Abstraction**: Simplify complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Examples**: Use loops and custom blocks to avoid repetitive code.

## Conditionals
- **Conditionals**: Programming blocks that execute code based on conditions.
- **Examples**: Check if a sprite is touching the mouse-pointer or detect video motion.

## Summing Up
- This course introduces you to computer science concepts and programming through practical and theoretical approaches.
- It’s normal to be new to programming, and the course will guide you through learning and problem-solving in this field.
